# Helper classes

The helper classes primarily serve as wrapper classes for use by  different methods used by the plugins. Other purposes include providing configuration data `PipelineConfig` or preparing `JCL` for a specific pipeline execution `JclSkeleton`.

## GitHelper

The [GitHelper](./GitHelper.md) class serves as a wrapper around the Git SCM plugin and provides these methods:

### [`GitHelper(steps)`](./GitHelper.md#GitHelper)

The constructor receives the `steps` from the pipeline to allow use of pipeline step within the class code.

### [`checkout(String gitUrl, String gitBranch, String gitCredentials, String tttFolder)`](./GitHelper.md#checkout)  

checks out the branch `gitBranch` in the Git(Hub) repository at `gitUrl`. It uses the `gitCredentials` to authenticate and places the cloned Git repository into the folder `tttFolder` within the Jenkins workspace.

### [`checkoutPath(String gitUrl, String gitBranch, String path, String gitCredentials, String gitProject)`](./GitHelper.md#checkoutPath) 

performs a *sparse checkout*, and checks out path `path` in the branch `gitBranch` in the project `gitProject` in the Git(Hub) repository at `gitUrl`. It uses the `gitCredentials` to authenticate.

## IspwHelper

The [IspwHelper](./IspwHelper.md) class serves as a wrapper around the Compuware ISPW plugin and provides these methods:  

### [`IspwHelper(steps, pConfig)`](./IspwHelper.md#ispwhelper) 

The constructor receives the `steps` from the pipeline to allow use of pipeline step within the class code and a [`PipelineConfig`](./#PipelineConfig) to make use of pipeline specific execution parameters.

### [`downloadAllSources(String ispwLevel)`](./IspwHelper.md#downloadallsources)

Downloads all COBOL sources and copybooks for the ISPW stream, application and level as stored in the `PipelineConfig`.

### [`downloadSources()`](./IspwHelper.md#downloadsources) 

Downloads all sources (COBOL programs and copybooks) contained in the [ISPW set](../../pipelines/basic_scenario.md) triggering the pipeline.

### [`downloadCopyBooks(String workspace)`](./IspwHelper.md#downloadcopybooks) 

Performs the following tasks:
- receives the path to the `workspace` for the pipeline job
- uses the `referencedCopyBooks` method to determine all copybooks used by the download COBOL programs
- uses a [`JclSkeleton`](./Jcl_skeletons.md) object's `createIebcopyCopyBooksJcl` method to create an `IEBCOPY` job `JCL` that copies all required copybooks in the list from the ISPW libraries into a temporary PDS
- submits this `JCL` using the [Topaz Utilities](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Compuware+Topaz+Utilities+Plugin) plugin
- downloads the content of the temporary PDS, using the [ISPW PDS downloader](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Compuware+Source+Code+Download+for+Endevor,+PDS,+and+ISPW+Plugin)
- uses the `JclSkeleton` method `jclSkeleton.createDeleteTempDsn` to create a `DELETE` job `JCL`
- and submits that `JCL`

### [`referencedCopyBooks(String workspace)`](./IspwHelper.md#referencedcopybooks) 

Performs the following tasks:
- receives the path to the `workspace` of the pipeline job
- searches all `*.cbl` program sources in the folder containing all downloaded sources and builds a list of COBOL programs
- for each program in the list it
  - reads the source file
  - scans the content for valid `COPY` statements (e.g. not comments)
  - determines the referenced copybook
  - add each copybook to the list of copybooks
- returns the resulting list of copybooks

### [`regressAssignmentList(assignmentList, cesToken)`](./IspwHelper.md#regressassignmentlist) 

Receives a list of assignment IDs in `assignmentList`, the [CES Token](../../tool_configuration/CES_credentials_token.md) in `cesToken` and calls method [`regressAssignment`](#regressassignment-assignment-cestoken) for each element of `assignmentList`

### [`regressAssignment(assignment, cesToken)`](./IspwHelper.md#regressassignment) 

Receives an Assignment ID in `assignment`, the [CES Token](../../tool_configuration/CES_credentials_token.md) in `cesToken` and uses the ISPW REST API to regress the assignment.

## JclSkeleton

The [JclSkeleton](./JclSkeleton.md) class allows the pipelines to customize pieces of `JCL` in certain, predefined ways. This allows changing e.g. `job cards`, `STEPLIB` concatenations and others during runtime. The `JCL` [skeletons](./Jcl_skeletons.md) are read from folder `./resources/skels` in the pipeline workspace.

### [`JclSkeleton(steps, String workspace, String ispwApplication, String ispwPathNum)`](./JclSkeleton.md#jclskeleton)

The constructor  receives the `steps` from the pipeline to allow use of pipeline step within the class code, the path to the pipeline `workpace`, the name of the ISPW application in `ispwApplication` and the [number of the development path](../../guidelines/ttt_scenario.md) in `pathNum`.

With the ISPW downloader the sources reside in folder `<ispw_application>/MF_Source` and the `downloadCopyBooks` method of the [`IspwHelper`](./IspwHelper.md) class copybooks will reside in the same folder as the COBOL sources `<ispw_application>/MF_Source`.
- [`sonar.cobol.file.suffixes`](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/COBOL+Plugin+Advanced+Configuration) file suffixes for the Sonar scanner to identify files that need to be scanned.
- [`sonar.cobol.copy.suffixes`](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/COBOL+Plugin+Advanced+Configuration) file suffixes for the Sonar scanner to identify COBOL copybooks.

## TttHelper

The [TttHelper](./TttHelper.md) class serves as a wrapper around Topaz for Total Test related activities like, executing the unit tests for the downloaded programs in a loop, and gathering the results from Code Coverage.

### [`TttHelper(script, steps, pConfig)`](./TttHelper.md#ttthelper) 

The constructor receives the `script` object and the `steps` from the pipeline  and a [`PipelineConfig`](./PipelineConfig.md) to make use of pipeline execution specific parameters.

### [`initialize()`](./TttHelper.md#initialize) 

Is used for additional initialization which cannot be executed in the constructor and does the following:

- Instantiates a `JclSkeleton` for later use by `loopThruScenarios()`.
- Builds a list of downloaded COBOL sources 
- Builds a list of downloaded `.testscenarios`.

### [`loopThruScenarios()`](./TttHelper.md#loopthruscenarios)

Loops through the `.testscenarios` and for each scenario:
- determines if the scenario matches one of the COBOL programs
- in that case
  - the job card of the corresponding runner jcl gets replaced by the configuration job card
  - the scenario gets executed

### [`executeFunctionalTests`](./TttHelper.md#executefunctionaltests)

Will execute all Topaz for Total Test functional test scenarios previously downloaded from Git.

### [`passResultsToJunit()`](./TttHelper.md#passresultstojunit) 

Uses the JUnit plugin to display the unit test results on the pipeline dashboard (and stored results in the pipeline output).

### [`collectCodeCoverageResults()`](./TttHelper.md#collectcodecoverageresults) 

Uses the Xpediter Code Coverage plugin to retrieve code coverage results from the Xpediter Code Coverage repository.

### [`cleanUpCodeCoverageResults()`](./TttHelper.md#cleanupcodecoverageresults)

Uses a JCL Skeleton and the resolting JCL to clean up statistics from the previous build in the Code Coverage repository. This prevents the repository dataset to be cluttered by statistics that are not being used anymore.
