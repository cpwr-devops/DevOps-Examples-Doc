# Code examples

These pages collect snippets, examples and documentation on pieces of code that are not used within the [primary pipelines](../pipelines/readme.md) themselves, but serve as guidelines in situations that may not fit into the "standard" scenario, or can be used when using other CI servers than Jenkins.

Especially in this latter case, the Compuware plugins cannot be used, and one would have to use the native [Topaz Workbench CLI](./topaz_cli.md).
