# Topaz CLI

The Topaz CLI (Command Line Interface) allows actions to be triggered on the mainframe without the need for the Topaz Eclipse Graphical User Interface (GUI).  The Topaz CLI can be used to automate various tasks from a variety of different methods such as from an integration server or within a build tool Jenkins or other CI servers.

The Topaz CLI is distributed via the full Topaz Workbench installation media and may be used to execute a set of Topaz and ISPW related functions from a batch/shell interface. A 64-bit Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required for the Topaz CLI. Refer to the *Topaz&reg; Workbench Installation Guide* for full installation details.  

After [installation](../tool_configuration/plugins.md#installing-the-topaz-workbench-cli), the command line interface folder contains a set of `.bat` files that can be used to execute the required functions.  

These are

`.bat` file | description
----------- | -----------
`CodeCoverageCLI.bat` | Allows downloading results from a Xpediter Code Coverage repository by specifying the repository name, system name and test ID.
`IspwCLI.bat` | Used for the Git to ISPW integration
`SCMDownloaderCLI.bat` | Allows interaction with the ISPW downloader to download sources from ISPW repositories, Endevor repositories or PDS 
`SubmitJclCLI.bat` | Allows submitting JCL on the mainframe and retrieving the return code
`TotalTestFTCLI.bat` | Allows execution of Topaz for Total Test scenarios and suites. This includes Total Test scenarios (.scenario) as well as unit test scenarios (.testscenario)
`TotalTestCLI.bat` | Deprecated. Use TotalTestFTCLI instead. Allows execution of Topaz for Total Test unit test scenarios and suites.

## Workspace

The Topaz Workbench CLI will want create a workspace to use during execution. Also, it will want to write to the `configuration` folder. Therefore, the user executing the Topaz Workbench CLI will:

- either need write access to the installation folders (containing the `configuration` folder) and the default workspace
- or will have to specify a workspace folder using the `-data` parameter during execution

For example:

```
CodeCoverageCLI.bat -data C:\Users\cwde-rnuesse\Compuware\Topaz\TopazCLIWorkspace
```

will create a workspace in the user's profile, copy the `configuration` folder into that workspace and use that workspace and it's content for execution. All `.bat` files may use the same workspace, once that has been created by any one of the files.

## Getting "online" help

Executing any of the `.bat` files without parameters, or with just the `-data` parameter, or with the `-help` parameter will return the help pages for the respective file. For example using the previous command will result in the following output:

```
Code Coverage CLI started, version = 19.02.01.

```

## Common parameters

Several parameters are common between the `.bat` files. These are:

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`-code <arg>` | the code page for the connection
`-help` | print help
`-host <arg>` | the host name or IP to be connected
`-id <arg>` | the user name
`-pass <arg>` | the user password (in clear text)
`-port <arg>` | the port to be connected
`-protocol <arg>` | the encryption protocol for the connection (None, Auto, SSLv3, TLS, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2)
`-timeout <arg>` | the timeout (in minutes) for the connection

## Specific parameters

In addition to the above parameters, the `.bat` files use parameters specific to each individual file.

## Xpediter Code Coverage (CodeCoverageCLI.bat)

The Xpediter Code Coverage CLI downloads code coverage results from from Xpediter and generates a code coverage file that SonarQube can consume. 

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`-cc.ddio.overrides <arg>` | comma separated list of DDIO overrides
`-cc.repos <arg>` | the code coverage repository (dataset name)
`-cc.sources <arg>` | comma separated list of source folders where the source has been downloaded to
`-cc.system <arg>` | the code coverage system name
`-cc.test <arg>` | the code coverage test name
`-targetFolder <arg>` | the target folder where the data will be downloaded to

### Example using Code Coverage Results

The following example will download the Code Coverage results from repository `'HDDRXM0.DEMO.COCO.REPOS'`, using the system `RXN3`, and test ID `646`. All resources reside on host `my.mainframe.host`, communicating on port `16196`. The results will be downloaded to the `Coverage` sub folder of the specified target folder. The sources to compare the Code Coverage results against are expected to reside in sub folder `RXN3\MF_Source`. (The latter requires that the sources of the programs in question have been downloaded already to the specified folder.)

## Total Test CLI (TotalTestFTCLI.bat)

With the Topaz for Total Test CLI interface you can execute Total Test scenarios (.scenario files) as well as unit test scenarios (.testscenario files).
There are many options for how you can execute test scenarios. You can specify a folder path and an environment ID or host+port, and the CLI interface will locate all relevant test scenario files in the folder, generate a test suite, execute this and optionally publish the results to the Total Test server. You can also point to a specific test scenario or test suite. If you point to a test scenario file, the CLI will automatically generate a test suite and produce result for the suite similar to using a folder. The generated test suite will be placed in a Suites folder under the folder being executed, and the execution result and logs will be placed in the Output folder. In this way the CLI works similar to Topaz, and results can be found and looked at in a consistent way.
The CLI will typically be used from a Continuous Integration server like Jenkins, where test scenario files have been checked out from the Version Control System. The same test scenarios that have been created and executed manually in Eclipse can now be executed automatically through the CLI interface.

The CLI interface will generate a log file in the logs directory in the location specified by the workspace directory. This log file can be used to track down and understand issues in an execution.

::: tip
In releases prior to the 20.05.01 release you had to use the unit test CLI (described later) for testing unit test scenarios. This is not necessary anymore. The TotalTestFTCLI is the "One CLI" that can handle all test scenario executions and the unit test CLI has been deprecated.
:::

### Test using 'SQL Select' or 'SQL Update'
When testing a Total Test scenario that contains one or more of the SQL Select or SQL Update elements, additional initial setup of the CLI installation must be done. These palette elements require DB2 jar files on the classpath for using JDBC to access DB2 on the mainframe, and these jar files must be available. By default the CLI looks for these jar files in \<install directory\>/dbDrivers. The user responsible for the CLI installation must create the directory and copy the customer specific DB2 jar files to this directory. Typically there are two jar files, one with the DB2 driver and one with the DB2 license. They are typically named db2jcc.jar and db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar.

Optionally the user can specify the environment variable TTT\_DB\_DRIVERS_PATH. The variable must be set to the directory containing the user specific DB2 jar files.

### CLI Arguments
The CLI interface is executed from a Windows or Linux terminal by writing:
`./TotalTestFTCLI.sh` or `TotalTestFTCLI.bat`
This will show the help for using the CLI as illustrated below.

                                           coverage reports.
 -s,--server <arg>                         Address to the CES Server, e.g.

                                           om/totaltestapi/. Can be left
                                           out which will result in no
                                           repository usage
 -sid,--siteid <arg>                       Site Id used for cloud license
                                           check
 -u,--userid <arg>                         tso userid
 -U,--use-scenario-files                   Find scenario files instead of
                                           context files and auto generate
                                           a context file for the selected
                                           environment for each scenario
                                           found
 -v,--sonar-version <arg>                  SonarQube version - either 5
                                           or 6. Default value is 6
 -x,--upload-result                        Upload result to server
```
The `--enviroment` (or the `--host` and `--port`) and the `--file` arguments are the primary ones, and the `--userid` and `--password` arguments for the TSO credential to be used. If the `--file` argument is relative, the `--root-folder` parameter is required. It is used to calculate the relative path to the folder being executed and this path is set at the result in the Functional Test server as the External Reference (if `--upload-result` option is used). Normally the root folder will be the folder to which files have been checked out from version control. With the Jenkins plugin the root folder will be set to the Jenkins workspace unless the `--file` path is absolute.
SonarQube and JUnit output files are also generated and placed in the TTTSonar and TTTUnit directories relative to the root folder given in the `--root-folder` parameter.

### Finding test scenarios
The CLI will by default look for and use .context files. A context file contain all the necessary runtime information in order to execute the scenario file. From release 20.04.01 .context files are created both for Total Test scenario files as well as unit test scenario files. The context file contains the id of the environment/host connection on which test scenarios are to be executed. The `--environment` parameter value given to the CLI must match the environmentId defined in the context file. It is also possible to specify the host connection ip address and port instead of the environment id. In this way the CLI makes sure to only find and execute the test scenarios that have been used for a particular host connection / environment.
It is possible to use the parameter `--use-scenario-files` to search for all .scenario files and use a default execution context created from the parameters given to the CLI. The parameter `--recursive` can be used to recursively traverse the folder structure under the `--file` path to search for test scenarios.
Example on finding all context files recursively in the current directory
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat --environment testenv --file . --recursive -s https://totaltest.xyz.com/totaltestapi/ -u XATUSER -p 123456
```
Same example, but using host and port instead of environment. Be aware that it will pick the first Batch environment from the repository server matching the host+port.
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat -host 1.2.3.4 -port 16196 --file . --recursive -s https://totaltest.xyz.com/totaltestapi/ -u XATUSER -p 123456
```
Example of executing all test scenarios under the Accounting folder where a git repository, GitProject containing test cases have been checked out to the folder /test/ws.
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat --environment testenv --root-folder /test/ws --file GitProject/Accounting --recursive --use-scenario-files -s https://totaltest.xyz.com/totaltestapi/  -u XATUSER -p 123456
```

### Executing unit test scenarios with specific runner JCL
It is possible to run a unit test scenario file directly with the CLI similar to using the deprecated unit test CLI. With this approach it will be necessary to provide the runner JCL file to be used for the executed with the `--runner-jcl`, or `-j` option. In this way it is possible to execute old and new unit test scenarios "the old way" where hard coded runner JCL is used. When using dynamically generated JCL and load libraries provided through the context file, it will not be necessary to use the `--runner-jcl` option. However, both approaches can be used and its up to the user which approach to use.
Example of executing a unit test scenario with hard coded runner.jcl
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat --host 1.2.3.4 --port 19196 --file /a/b/Scenarios/test.testscenario --runner-jcl /a/b/JCL/runner.jcl -cfgdir /a/c/TotalTestConfiguration -u XATUSER -p 123456
```

::: warning IMPORTANT 
In the 20.5.1 release, using the `--runner-jcl` parameter will require that the TotalTestConfiguration project to be present (option --configuration-directory or -cfgdir), or that the repository server is available (option --server or -s). This is actually a requirement for all CLI executions. In a future release this requirement will probably be removed when executing unit test scenarios directly with hard coded runner JCL to make it easier to setup the CLI execution since the information from the project/server in this use case is not required.
:::

### Using the Total Test repository server and CES with authentication
When using the Total Test repository server and CES has user authorization enabled, it is necessary to specify the CES userid and password in order to access the server. This is done with the parameters `--ces-user` (`-cesu`) and `--ces-password` (`-cesp`).
Example on command for CES with authorization
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat -host 1.2.3.4 -port 16196 -cesu johnd -cesp 654321 --file . --recursive -s https://totaltest.xyz.com/totaltestapi/ -u XATUSER -p 123456
```

### Works with and without the Total Test repository server
The CLI can be used to execute batch test scenarios for customers where the Total Test repository server has not been setup. In this case, the `--server` parameter is simply excluded. The environment id for which to execute is found in the hostconnections.tttcfg file located under the TotalTestConfiguration folder as the id for the connection. It is also possible, and easier, to simply specify the host and port with the `-host` and `-port` options. When the `--server` parameter is not specified, the CLI will expect the TotalTestConfiguration folder to be located under the `--root-folder` path. If it is located elsewhere, for instance on a shared folder on a Jenkins server, the parameter `--configuration-directory` can be used to give a path to the TotalTestConfiguration folder, including the folder name itself.
Example of not using the repository and assuming that the TotalTestConfiguration folder is located in the current folder
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat -host 1.2.3.4 -port 16196 testenv --file . --recursive -u XATUSER -p 123456
```
Example of not using the repository where a root path is given and another path to the TotalTestConfiguration folder. This could be a setup for a Jenkins server
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat -host 1.2.3.4 -port 16196 --root-folder /testdata/jenkins/ws/ --configuration-directory /testdata/config/TotalTestConfiguration --file . --recursive -u XATUSER -p 123456
```

### Using Topaz for Enterprise Data
If any of the test cases to be executed use the Topaz for Enterprise Data element, the CLI must setup the parameters required by TED. These include the `--ces-url` parameter and optionally the `--siteid` and `--customerid` if cloud licensing is used. Furthermore the File-AID services ip address and port (for the Connection Manager), and the File-AID workspace must be set by the parameters `--file-aid-service-ip`, `--file-aid-service-port`, and `--file-aid-workspace`.
Example of not using the repository and assuming that the TotalTestConfiguration folder is located in the current folder
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat -host 1.2.3.4 -port 16196 --root-folder /testdata/jenkins/ws/ --file . --ces-url http://ces.xyz.com --file-aid-service-ip 1.2.3.4 --file-aid-service-port 1234 --file-aid-workspace utils/fileaidws --recursive -u XATUSER -p 123456
```
The File-AID workspace can be copied from a Topaz workspace to where the CLI is to be used. The File-AID workspace directory is located in the .com.compuware.fileaid.ex folder under the workspace root. Default location is C:\Users\<userid>\Compuware\Workbench\workspace\.com.compuware.fileaid.ex.
In the above example the absolute path to the File-AID workspace is /testdata/jenkins/ws/utils/fileaidws/, and this folder must contain the folder .com.compuware.fileaid.ex.

### Intelligent test case execution
The CLI can be used to intelligently selecting only the test scenarios related to specific programs. The program names to be tested can be given as a comma separated list of names to the `--program-names` parameter, or the `--program-names-file` parameter can be used to give a path to a json file containing the programs that have changed. The format of the json file is the same as ISPW can produce after a generate, and in this way a pipeline can be setup to get ISPW find programs that have changed and Total Test can then find the test cases to test.
Format of the JSON file looks like below.
``` JSON
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "programs": [
    {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "programName": "XARISCAL",
      "programLanguage": "COB",
      "isImpact": true,
      "application": "KTTA",
      "stream": "CPWR",
      "level": "DEV1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example of not using the repository and given programs names directly. If more than one name is given, the comma separated list must be inside "".
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat -host 1.2.3.4 -port 16196 --file . --program-names "XARISCAL,XAPGMTST" --recursive -u XATUSER -p 123456
```
Example of not using the repository and given programs names through a json file.
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat -host 1.2.3.4 -port 16196 --file . --program-names-file /testdata/jenkins/ws/changedPrograms.json --recursive -u XATUSER -p 123456
```
### Overriding Context parameters
Several parameters can be added to the CLI command which will override the values set in the individual context files. This includes code coverage options, accounting info used to submit jobs, what result files that are generated and the log level.
It is also possible to override context variables. Context variables are key/value pairs that have been setup by a user in the execution dialog and saved in the .context file. The context variables are available by the test engine and can be used to parameterize a test scenario. From the CLI, context variables can be provided by the user, and these will override the values in the .context files which will end up as variables in the test scenarios being executed.
Example of providing two context variables level and customerId. Test scenarios that have been setup to use these parameters will get the values provided in the argument, i.e. level and 1234. The argument needs to be encapsulated by double quotes.
```
TotalTestFTCLI.bat -host 1.2.3.4 -port 16196 --file . --context-variables "level=PDSE,customerId=1234" --recursive -u XATUSER -p 123456
```

## Deprecated Total Test Unit Test CLI (TotalTestCLI.bat)

The Total Test Unit Test CLI runs Total Test unit tests.  The test suite or scenario must have been defined in the Topaz for Total Test Unit Test Eclipse client. The command line tools expect a complete Topaz for Total Test Unit Test project structure.
::: danger
The Total Test Unit Test CLI has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead the TotalTestFTCLI.bat CLI, described before, should be used. It can handle execution of unit test scenarios as well as Total Test scenarios.
:::

### Usage
Executing unit test scenarios is done with the `TotalTestCLI.bat` file. The general syntax for using the `TotalTestCLI.bat` is 
```
TotalTestCLI.bat -cmd=<command> options
```
The most important command is the `runtest` command, which will excute all of the other commands in sequence. Each command uses an individual set of options and can be seen in details in later sections.

### Complete End to End Run
Use the runtest command to perform a complete end to end run of a Topaz for Total Test test suite or test scenario. See [Test Runner](#test-runner-parameters-options) for more information. For example:
```
TotalTestCLI.bat -cmd=runtest -h=mfhost -pt=10239 -u=tsoab71 -pw=AKznXY -p=c:\Users\Username\Compuware\Workbench\workspace\TotalTestProject -ts=CWXTCOB_Scenario.testscenario -te=1047 -j=Runner.jcl
```
This example will execute all the test cases in "CWXTCOB_Scenario.testscenario" for project "TotalTestProject" on host "mfhost" using port "10239" and log on information UserID "tsoab71" with password "AKznXY" and submit "Runner.JCL".

### Execute Individual Steps
If you want to execute the individual steps, one at a time, to run a test, execute them in this order:
1. Use the build command to create the binary input files for the test case(s) using the Binary Builder. See [Binary Builder](#binary-builder-parameters-options) for more information.
2. Use the upload command to upload the binary files created by the Binary Builder to the mainframe. See [File Transfer](#file-transfer-parameters-options) for more information.
3. Use the submit command to submit the JCL to execute the Topaz for Total Test Runner on the mainframe. Note that the binary files need to be uploaded before submitting the JCL to execute the Test Runner. See [JCL Submit](#jcl-submit-parameters-options) for more information.
4. Use the download command to retrieve the result from the mainframe Topaz for Total Test Test Runner execution. See  [File Transfer](#file-transfer-parameters-options) for more information.
5. Use the parse command to unpack the binary test results file created by the Topaz for Total Test Runner. See [Binary Parser](#binary-parser-parameters-options) for more information.
6. Use the resultcheck command to analyze the test results against the test check conditions. The result checker will output test archive files containing the test results. See Result Checker](#result-checker-parameters-options) for more information.

The batch script is in the directory where the Topaz Workbench CLI was installed. To execute the script, the configuration directory must be writable.

::: tip
If you install CLI in the default location (C:\Program Files\Compuware\Topaz Workbench CLI) or a Read-only location, you must add the -data parameter to specify the path to your workspace, for example:
```
TotalTestCLI.bat -cmd=<command> options -data=C:\Users\Username\Compuware\Workbench\workspace
```
The error message `The configuration area at C:\Program Files\Compuware\Topaz Workbench CLI\configuration is not writable. Please choose a writable location using the '-configuration' line command.`
is an indication that the -data parameter is required.
:::

A challenge with using the individual commands in sequence - instead of using the `runtest` command - is that using the `upload`, the CLI will 'randomly' generate names for the target binary files on the mainframe (To be more precise, the 'ID' qualifier is generated randomly). Currently, there is no known, simple way to control these names or determine which names have been generated. Therefore, we will concentrate on the `runtest` command.

### CLI commands
The following table lists the valid commands to invoke them from the command line. For options see the parameters explained below for each CLI component.
Command | Component          | Description
--------- |------------------ | ----------------------------------
`build` | Binary Builder |Parses a test suite or test scenario and creates the required binary files.
`upload` | File Transfer |Uploads the parsed local binary files to the target host system.
`submit` | JCL Submit |Submit JCL to run a test.
`download` | File Transfer |Downloads the test results from the target host to a local file.
`parse` | Binary Parser|Parses the local binary result file and updates the archive (history).
`resultscheck` | Result Checker |Parses the updated archive  (history), applying the check conditions to the output data and updating the archive accordingly.
`runtest` | Test Runner |Performs all the above commands (in the specified order).

All options have the following format:
`parameter=value`
If the value contains spaces, the entire option must be enclosed in quotes, for example:
`"-t=c:\TotalTestProject\Unit Test\Suites\SimpleTest.testsuite"`
To set the logging level of the CLI tools logging output, see [Debug Options](#debug-options).

### Debug Options
The following table lists the debug parameters that can be used for all commands.

Parameter | Abbr. | Description
---------|---------|-----------
`-loglevel` | -log | The logging level. Must be INFO, WARN, DEBUG or ERROR. The default is INFO.
`-logparms` | -lp | Indicates if the various components run parameters should be logged before the run. Must be TRUE or FALSE. The default is TRUE.

### Test Runner - parameters/options
The Test Runner component allows for the complete end to end run of a Topaz for Total Test test suite or test scenario. The following tables list the input and optional parameters that must be provided in addition to the required parameters for all CLIs, i.e. host, port, user, password :

**Test Runner input parameters**
| Parameter/Option | Abbr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Description |
