# Topaz API

The Topaz API is a Java library that can be used in Java applications to programmatically access and perform operations on datasets and perform JES operations, as well as launch and communicate with their own z/OS programs.

If you are using the Topaz API for plug-ins meant to be run in a Topaz Workbench environment, you should use the [Topaz Workbench SDK](Topaz_Workbench_SDK.md) instead.

The Compuware Topaz API Specification (Javadoc) can be found <a href="../javadoc/topaz_api/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  

## Dependencies

The Topaz API depends on (and is packaged with) other internal Compuware libraries and 3rd party libraries. The internal Compuware libraries are likely to change without notice, and any use of them is not supported.

This is the list of dependent libraries you must include in your class path, in order to use the Topaz API:

## Coding Examples

[Topaz Workbench API Code Snippets](Topaz_Workbench_API_Code_Snippets.md) provides may useful examples on using the Topaz API. Though a few of the examples are specific for writing plug-ins running in a Topaz Workbench client, most of the examples are also applicable for writing Java applications.
