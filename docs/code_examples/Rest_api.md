Compuware's Rest APIs are documented in [Swagger](https://swagger.io/solutions/api-documentation/), a commonly used format.  The Rest APIs are hosted in Compuware Enterprise Services, which connects to the underlying mainframe products to perform various actions on the mainframe.  

The APIs use a token based authentication for securely accessing the mainframe.  Please visit the [CES Credentials](../tool_configuration/CES_credentials_token.md) for more information about setting up a Personal Access Token for the APIs.

Please visit our [Swagger REST API documentation](https://ispw.api.compuware.com/) for more details on the various APIs.

For an example of how to call the Rest API from a scripting language, please see this [Powershell script](./ISPW_Operations.ps1) that calls ISPW's API.
